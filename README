NAME

    Printer::ESCPOS::Connections::Serial - Serial Connection Interface for
    Printer::ESCPOS (supports status commands)

VERSION

    version 0.001

ATTRIBUTES

 portName

    The portName maps to both the Registry Device Name and the Properties
    associated with that device. A single Physical port can be accessed
    using two or more Device Names. But the options and setup data will
    differ significantly in the two cases. A typical example is a Modem on
    port COM2. Source : Win32::SerialPort

 baudrate

    When used as a local serial device you can set the baudrate of the
    printer too. Default (38400) will usually work, but not always.

    This param may be specified when creating printer object to make sure
    it works properly.

    $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(deviceFilePath => '/dev/ttyACM0',
    baudrate => 9600);

 readConstTime

    Seconds per unfulfilled read call, default 150

 serialOverUSB

    Set this value to 1 if you are connecting your printer using the USB
    Cable but it shows up as a serial device

METHODS

 read

    Read Data from the printer

 print

    Sends buffer data to the printer.
